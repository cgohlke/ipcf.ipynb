    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Spatiotemporal analysis of fluorescence fluctuations of optical microscopy measurements on living samples is a powerful tool that can provide insight into dynamic molecular processes of high biological relevance (Di Rienzo et al., 2016).\n",
    "\n",
    "Pair correlation function (pCF) analysis of fluorescence microscopy image time series acquired using very fast cameras is one of the emerging and promising spatiotemporal techniques. However, it is computationally very expensive, and the analysis of big image data sets used to take hours or be impractical on personal computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we use the open-source Python programming language and scientific libraries to compute the pCF analysis of a large time series of fluorescence images acquired with Selective Plane Illumination Microscopy (SPIM).\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we implement a function to calculate the cross-correlation of two time series. We demonstrate the limitations of Python for efficient numerical computations and several ways to overcome them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we implement the pCF analysis of a small simulated image time series and optimize its speed by almost two orders of magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we use this pCF analysis function to analyze a multi-gigabyte image time series in small, overlapping chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a tutorial on computing pair correlations in big images. Refer to the references for an introduction to the pair correlation method and how the computed pair correlations can be analyzed and visualized to study molecular flow in cells."

    "Putting the limitations into perspective: besides CPU bound numerical calculations, there are many other tasks that are part of an efficient image processing pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Many tasks are **I/O bound** (load or save data from/to the Internet, hard drive, or databases) and can be efficiently multi-threaded in Python.\n",

    "As an image analyst or end user of imaging software, Python can be used\n",
